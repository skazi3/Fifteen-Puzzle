# Fifteen-Puzzle- the classic fifteen puzzle game implemented in Java

Project 2: fifteen puzzle
10.02.2017

Instructions & Notes:
Extra Credit is yet to be implemented!
Many of the methods had too many dependencies which is why they are all in one class
This program contains three classes: MyButton (Which extends JButton), Tuple, and the Fifteen Puzzle class
If Mix causes an error in the first try please exit and mix again. Sometimes the empty string gets found when shuffling but this only happens some of the times!

This project was made in Eclipse and it will be a pleasant experience if compiled in Eclipse especially.

Some Extra fixes: As for now auto-solve does not find a clear solution through breadth first search. If a working solution is found it will print "Found!" But will not update the board. This is still in progress!

Happy grading :)
